# recursion

The point of this project is to familiarize myself with recursive functions. These two exercises should help show the difference between an iterative function and a recursive one that accomplish same the task. I originally did these as exercises as opposed to a project, so the process of my work was done on codepen.io and won't be avaiable in prior commits.
